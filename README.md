# Note-Taker
## Description
- This project was application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
- This app uses an Express.js back end that saves and retrieves data to a JSON file.
- While building this app I have gained experience with routing, modularization, and the crud operations through express js. 
- This app has also introduced me to deploying on Heroku.
